          <div class="text">Meet Janis. She is a 6 year old long-haired tabby cat. I adopted her on March 29th, 2016. 
            Around 1 year ago, Janis got gum disease and had to get her teeth removed. Luckily, she recovered. Although, she 
            has to swalow her food now. Janis is a spoiled cat but we love her. Anyways, want to buy her a treat?</div>
